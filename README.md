# Hugo Editor

A markdown editor for Hugo blogs (built for [aifoc.us](https://aifoc.us) and [paul.kinlan.me](https://paul.kinlan.me)). It runs in the browser, is hosted on Cloudflare Workers, and edits the site folders on your machine directly through the File System Access API.

## What works today (step 1: the editor)

- **Local folders, remembered.** Add a Hugo site folder once. The directory handle is stored in IndexedDB, so next time you only confirm access. Several sites can be added and switched between.
- **Reads your Hugo config.** It finds `hugo.toml` / `config.toml` (and the YAML/JSON variants), the content directory, the theme, and permalink rules. That covers both the `[permalinks.page]` style used by aifoc.us and the flat `content/*.markdown` layout of paul.kinlan.me.
- **Post list.** Every content file is listed newest first, with filter, section and drafts-only views.
- **Editor.** CodeMirror 6 with markdown highlighting, highlighted Hugo shortcodes, and an "Insert shortcode" menu built from the site's and theme's `layouts/shortcodes`.
- **Front matter form.** It is generated from the keys the post already has, with a raw editor for anything else. Edits rewrite only the changed key, so comments, ordering, quoting and line folding stay as written. Checked against all 869 posts in both blogs: opening and saving a post without changes is byte-identical.
- **New posts.** Front matter is copied from the most recent post in the same section, so aifoc.us posts get `seotitle`/`authors` and paul.kinlan.me posts get `summary`/`tags`. The file extension matches too. New posts start as drafts.
- **Images.** Drop or paste an image to save it under `static/images/<slug>/` and insert a `figure` shortcode (or plain markdown if the site has no `figure`).
- **Safe saves.** Ctrl/⌘+S saves. The editor warns before overwriting a file that changed on disk, and reloads clean files that changed while the tab was in the background.
- **Live preview.** The post as rendered by your local `hugo server`, with the site's real theme. Hugo's live reload refreshes it on save. Each site has its own preview address (defaults: 1313, 1314, …).

Folder access needs Chrome or Edge. Other browsers can use "Try a sample site", which lives in the browser's private file system.

## Running it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm test           # unit tests (front matter, permalinks, templates)
npm run typecheck
npm run deploy     # build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

### Deploys and branch previews

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds, typechecks and tests every push. Pushes to `main` then deploy the `markdown-editor` Worker. Every other branch deploys its own preview Worker, `markdown-editor-<branch>`, and the workflow posts its URL on the branch's PR. The preview Worker is deleted when the PR closes. Previews are whole Workers because Cloudflare's preview URLs don't work for Workers with Durable Objects, which the agent backend uses.

Deploys need two repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (a token with *Workers Scripts: Edit*) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Until they are set, the workflow only builds and tests.

For the preview, start Hugo in your site folder. Use `-D` so drafts render, and a different port per site:

```sh
hugo server -D --port 1313   # aifoc.us
hugo server -D --port 1314   # paul.kinlan.me
```

When the editor is served from Cloudflare (https) and the preview is on `http://localhost`, Chrome asks for **Local network access** the first time you press Connect.

## Layout

```
src/lib/frontmatter.ts   Post parsing and minimal-diff front matter edits (YAML/TOML/JSON)
src/lib/hugo.ts          Hugo config, permalinks, shortcode discovery
src/lib/posts.ts         Post index and new-post templates
src/lib/fs.ts            File System Access helpers
src/lib/sites.ts         Persisted directory handles and permissions
src/components/          Lit elements: app shell, editor, front matter form, preview
worker/index.ts          Cloudflare Worker (serves the app; agent backend goes here)
```

## Plan

1. **Editor** (this): local folders, editing, front matter, live Hugo preview.
2. **Agents.** Pi Durable harnesses in Durable Objects, one per post conversation. Configurable models (Claude, DeepSeek, …). Tools for web search, search across past posts, and grammar/style edits returned as diffs to accept. User-defined edits.
3. **Demos, ACP and publishing.** A builder for aifoc.us-style inline demos and infographics, and ACP connections to external agent harnesses. Also git commit/push and an optional hosted preview. Running ACP, git and `hugo server` from the browser goes through a small local helper app.
